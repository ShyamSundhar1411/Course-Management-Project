## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

This project follows a **clean architecture** based on the **MVCS pattern**, promoting **separation of concerns** and testability.

### ðŸ“¦ Layers
- **Models**: Define the database structure (e.g., `Student`, `Faculty`, `Course`, `Enrollment`).
- **Views (Controllers)**: Handle HTTP requests and orchestrate logic via services.
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic (e.g., course creation, enrollment validation).
- **Forms**: Manage user input and validation.
- **Infrastructure**: Manage Low Level Database interactions and acts as a wrapper of model functions with improvised error handling.
- **Templates**: Handle presentation logic using Django templating and Bootstrap.
- **Utilities**: Store constants, messages, and reusable logic.

> âœ… All business logic lives in `services/`, keeping views thin and focused on request/response handling.
